ArduinoSerialWrapper
====================

About
-----

This is a cross-platform serial communications library for C programming on Windows/Linux/Mac that implements the same interface as the Serial library for Arduino. The point is so you can easily port Arduino libraries to the desktop. It is uses MIT licensed <https://github.com/wjwwood/serial> as the underlying cross-platform serial library.

It's a work in progress. ;-)
